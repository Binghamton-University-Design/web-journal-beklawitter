					<h2>Project 2:  Scalable Icons</h2>
					<p><img src="threeicons.png"></p>
					<p>In this project, we focused not only on creating three icons that go together, but also on making icons that would look good scaled very big and very small. We had to make the icons colored and in back and white. For each version, we had to resize and rework each icon to look good in three sizes: 128 pixels, 64 pixels, and 32 pixels. When I was trying to come up with ideas for my icons, I thought about stuff I liked and stuff I enjoyed doing. I also decided to use a circle as my main, unifying shape. And, with that, I came up with the following:
					</p>
					<p>I love writing, so I knew that I wanted to do something with that. I sketched many different writing implements such as a laptop, a typewriter, a notebook, and a hand holding a pen. I decided to go with a quill and paper because I thought it looked elegant and I also really like how the paper and quill could stick out of the circle.
					</p>
					<p>For the next icon, I decided to focus on a place I enjoy going to. Every summer, my family and other families we’re friends with go to the Outer Banks, North Carolina for a week. I always look forward to this trip so I wanted to find a way to represent it for this project. I knew I wanted to include sand, water, the sun, and an umbrella, but I wasn’t sure if I should add anything else. I played around with putting either a chair or a beach towel under the umbrella, however, it began to look too busy. Once I decided on what the components of the icon would be, I had to choose colors for it. I easily found a blue and a sandy color that I liked; the sun would be yellow. But I didn’t know what color to make the umbrella and the sky. For the sky, I thought it would be interesting to leave the space transparent so that it could become any color the icon is in front of. The sky at the beach is always pretty, especially during sunrise and sunset so I thought the dynamic element caused by keeping the ‘sky’ transparent would make the icon better!</p>
					<p>My final icon is my favorite. I decided to represent my love of Scotland because I studied abroad there in the fall semester of 2018. The white cross with the blue background is for the Scottish flag. And the thistle is the national flower of Scotland. I found an image online for the flag and used the eyedropper tool to find the correct color blue. However, I thought it wouldn’t let the thistle stand out so I decided to lighten it a little. For the thistle, I found a photograph of one of the plants and used it as a reference when creating the vector image on Illustrator. I also used the eyedropper tool on the photograph of the flower to find the proper pinks and purples.</p>
					<p>When it came to making the icons black and white, the only one I struggled with was the thistle. I wanted to keep the cross in the background but only being able to work with two colors meant that some part of the thistle would blend in with the background. So, what I ended up doing was making the background all black and the thistle white with an outline. Though, I still wish there was a way to keep the Scottish flag aspect in this version, I am happy with how it came out!</p>

					<h2>Project 1: 
						Isometric Avatar</h2>
					<p><img src="Avatar.png"></p>
					<p>For this first project, I used Adobe Illustrator and an isometric grid to make an avatar of myself. The most challenging part was figuring out how to make the avatar look good while still fitting to the isometric grid. Once I figured that out, I began thinking about the details I wanted my avatar to have. I wanted her to have short hair, like I do currently. I also wanted her to be interacting with something writing-related because writing is one of my passions. I decided to have her leaning on a giant fountain pen and I really like how she came out!
